# RC-log-app
I'm an RC aeromodeling lover, not a coder, who built RCLog with AI to track my planes &amp; flights from a personal need, lacking dev skills. Let's make it a human-centered tool for RC fans! Join to improve the UI, add features, or fix bugs. Your help means a lot! also i offer co-authorship for those who want to collaborate in this proyect. ðŸš´ #Python #RC #OpenSource
